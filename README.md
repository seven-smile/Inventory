# Inventory Management System

Welcome to the Inventory Management System! This project was developed as part of a class assignment and serves as an example of an inventory management solution implemented in Java. The application aims to assist businesses in efficiently managing their inventory, tracking stock levels, and streamlining the overall inventory management process.

## Features

1. **Product Management:** The system provides functionality to add, update, and delete products in the inventory. Each product is associated with essential information such as name, description, quantity, price, and supplier details.

2. **Inventory Tracking:** Users can track the quantity and availability of products in real-time. The system allows for easy retrieval of information on current stock levels, ensuring efficient inventory management and preventing stockouts or overstocking.

3. **Order Management:** Users can generate and manage purchase orders within the system. This feature enables seamless tracking of incoming orders, recording supplier details, and managing the procurement process effectively.

4. **Sales Management:** The system facilitates the recording and tracking of sales transactions. It allows users to generate sales orders, update stock levels accordingly, and maintain a comprehensive sales history for reference and analysis.

5. **Reporting and Analytics:** Users can generate reports and analyze inventory data to gain insights into product performance, stock turnover rates, and overall business profitability. These reports assist in making informed decisions regarding inventory replenishment, identifying slow-moving items, and optimizing stock levels.

6. **User Authentication and Access Control:** The system provides secure user authentication, allowing only authorized individuals to access and modify inventory data. User roles and permissions can be assigned to control access levels within the system.

## Technologies Used

The Inventory Management System was developed using Java and utilizes several libraries and frameworks, including:

- **Java SE Development Kit (JDK):** A software development environment used for building Java applications.
- **JavaFX:** A Java library for building desktop applications with a rich user interface.
- **Apache Maven:** A build automation tool for managing project dependencies and creating executable JAR files.
- **MySQL:** A popular relational database management system used to store inventory data.
- **Java Database Connectivity (JDBC):** A Java API for connecting and interacting with the MySQL database.

## Installation and Setup

To run the Inventory Management System locally, follow these steps:

1. Clone the repository from [GitHub Repository URL].
2. Install the Java SE Development Kit (JDK) and set up the Java development environment on your machine.
3. Set up and configure a MySQL database server. Create the necessary tables and schema based on the provided SQL scripts.
4. Update the database connection settings in the application configuration file to match your MySQL database credentials.
5. Build the project using Apache Maven to resolve project dependencies and create an executable JAR file.
6. Run the JAR file and launch the Inventory Management System application.

Please refer to the project's documentation or the README file within the repository for detailed installation and setup instructions.

## Future Enhancements

While this class project provides a functional inventory management system, there are several potential areas for future enhancements and expansion, such as:

- Adding support for barcode scanning to simplify and expedite product identification and inventory updates.
- Implementing automatic stock replenishment functionality based on predefined reorder points or sales patterns.
- Enhancing the reporting and analytics capabilities with visualizations and customizable reports to aid in decision-making.
- Integrating with other business systems, such as accounting software or e-commerce platforms, for seamless data exchange.
- Improving the user interface and user experience with more intuitive navigation, interactive dashboards, and responsive design.
